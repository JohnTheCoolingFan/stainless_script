# Stainless Script

Stainless Script is a visual node-based programming language.

The structure is as follows: program contains classes and objects (constants). Class desribes a data type and its associated methods, which are nodes and their variations. Nodes are executed one-by-one in sequence. Additionally, data can be passed from one node to other using connections that carry Objects. Node can specify what Class are the objects it outputs or inputs.
