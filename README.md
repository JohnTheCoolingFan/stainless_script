# Stainless Script

Stainless Script is a visual node-based programming language.

The structure is as follows: program contains classes and objects (constants). Class desribes a data type and its associated methods, which are nodes and their variations. Nodes are executed one-by-one in sequence. Additionally, data can be passed from one node to other using connections that carry Objects. Node can specify what Class are the objects it outputs or inputs.

This repo contains basic data structures and logic for executing the code, as well as an executor binary (not yet) that can be modified to add native rust modules by forking the repo.
